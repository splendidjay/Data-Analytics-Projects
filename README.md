# Entry-Level Data Analyst Portfolio

## Introduction
Hello! I'm Ijeoma Modelyne Omobolaji, an aspiring Data Analyst committed to refining my skills in data handling and analysis. This repository serves as a portfolio of projects showcasing my growing expertise in using tools such as Excel, SQL, Power BI, and Tableau to drive insights and support data-driven decision-making.

## Portfolio Projects

### Project 1: Coffee Orders Data
**Objective**: The primary objective of this project is to analyze coffee orders data to uncover key trends and insights that can drive strategic business decisions.

**Tools Used**:
- Excel for data cleaning and manipulation
- Excel for creating interactive dashboards.

### Project 2: Sales Data Project
**Objective**: This project provides a comprehensive analysis of sales data for household gadgets and phone accessories, aiming to uncover key market insights and consumer behaviors. The analysis focuses on identifying the cities with the highest order volumes and quantities, determining which states generate the most orders, and ranking the top and bottom five cities by order volume and quantity. Additionally, the project identifies the top five best and least selling products, their average sales, and the total revenue generated. This data-driven approach aids in understanding regional sales dynamics and product performance, supporting strategic business decision-making.

**Tools Used**:
- Excel for cleaning and transforming data.
- Excel Analysis Toolpak for Descriptive Analysis.
- Excel for visualizing with interactive dashboards.

- ### Project 3: Pizza Sales Project
**Objective**: This SQL-driven project delves into a comprehensive analysis of a large dataset concerning pizza sales. The primary goals are to evaluate total revenue and examine sales trends over time, including identifying peak sales hours, days, and months. The analysis also quantifies the percentage of average order value and ranks the top five best and least selling pizza varieties. Utilizing SQL techniques such as aggregate functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG), GROUP BY, ORDER BY, and date-related functions (DATEPART, DATENAME), plus type casting (CAST), this project highlights critical sales insights and patterns essential for optimizing business strategies and operational efficiency.

**Tools Used**: 
- SQL for data querying.

## Skills and Learning
Through my projects, I am continuously learning and applying:
